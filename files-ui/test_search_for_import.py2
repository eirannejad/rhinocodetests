NOTE:

- Reference to RhinoCommmon.dll is added by default

- Python 2 is out of support and 'pip' package manager
  does not work for python 2. You can specify your script requirements like:
    
    # wheel: <wheel-file-name.whl>

    For example this line will ask the runtime to install
    the listed packages before running the script:

    # wheel: natsort-3.5.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl

    You can download wheel files from PyPI.org for required packages.
    Make sure to choose a version that supports python >=2.7

- Use env directive to add an environment path to sys.path automatically
    # env: /path/to/your/site-packages/
